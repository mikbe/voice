# voice.py

A Colloquy plugin for speaking chat and events  

*Copyright 2014* Mike Bethany  

Inspired by speech.py by James Tatum  

Version 0.1.0
Initial design. Lots of redundant code.  
Should be more meta but I don't know Python.   

No unused code or includes, best practices followed where I know them,  
Metaprogramming where appropriate, single responsibility methods(!),  
code should be self commenting so comments held to a minimum.

Also, I don't care what PEP says, LINE UP YOUR DAMN VARIABLES!
